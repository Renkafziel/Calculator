Hello Guys,
This is very first application. Created using Netbeans IDE.
In this Application, You can do basic calculations like addition, subtraction, division and multiplication.
There is a option to clear the label after performing calculations. The button name is "C".
If your work is completed and you want to exit. The button name is "Cancel".

I think a person will get a satisfaction while running his/her own application on the system.
